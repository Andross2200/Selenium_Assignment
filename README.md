# Selenium Assignment
This is an assignment that I completed as a part of Software Quality and Testing course while studying for my Master's
degree in Computer Science at Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest, Hungary.

This course required me to write Selenium tests for an existing website. For my assignment I have chosen to run my tests
on [Steam Store](https://store.steampowered.com/). The requirements and their fulfilment can be seen in a
[fulfilment sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SAckjKkOG6m_PRI45P-G8R4fjVl7bGJ9VpyVrO9-a1Q/edit?usp=sharing).
